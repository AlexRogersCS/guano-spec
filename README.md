*The GUANO bat acoustic metadata format specification*

GUANO is the Grand Unified Acoustic Notation Ontology, an extensible, open format for embedding metadata within bat acoustic recordings.

This is the source repository where the metadata format specification *itself* is maintained. You probably want to see the actual [GUANO metadata format specification](doc/guano_specification.md): [guano_specification.md](guano_specification.md).

The [GUANO project homepage](http://guano-md.org) is a friendlier site where you'll find information on using the metadata, which products support it, etc. See: http://guano-md.org

If you're a hardware developer, software developer, or an end user interested in working with the GUANO metadata format, we offer the following Open Source reference libraries:

* [guano-py](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-py) (Also includes helpful utilities)
* [guano-r](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-r)
* [guano-java](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-java)
* [guano-c](https://github.com/riggsd/guano-c)

Finally, if you're simply looking for help (aren't we all??), try the [GUANO discussion email list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/guano-md).
